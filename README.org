#+title: QaTeX

A LaTeX major-mode using tree-sitter.

Unfortunately, tree-sitter-latex has multiple issues
- Maths aren't centralized
  - No common anscestor to ~display_equation~ and ~inline_formula~
  - You must query yourself against envs that are align/gather/etc
- Grouping is odd
  - in ~\[a b \alpha^c_d\]~, tree-sitter-latex would put ~a b~ in a ~text~ child,
    ~\alpha~ in a ~generic_command~ child, and ~^b_c~ in another ~text~ child
  - ~$abc\)~ is valid maths
